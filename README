Project 1

All parts of the ray tracer are working as expected.

Current implemented features are:
 * Adjustable Camera
 * Point lights, spheres, and infinite planes
 * Phong Shading
 * Shadows
 * Specifiable resolutions (default is 1024x768)

Times for simple.pov at 640x480

real  0m0.158s
user  0m0.055s
sys   0m0.080s

Note: A point light was added to the simple.pov file so that the phong shading 
      would show.
